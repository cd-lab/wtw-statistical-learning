jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. jsPsych provides a framework for defining experiments using a set of flexible plugins that create different kinds of tasks a subject could complete during an experiment. By assembling these different plugins together it is possible to create many different types of experiments.

Examples
----------

Several example experiments and plugin demonstrations are available in the `/examples` folder.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at [docs.jspsych.org](http://docs.jspsych.org).

Response times
--------------

Wondering if jsPsych can be used for research that depends on accurate response time measurement? For most purposes, the answer is yes. Response time measurements in jsPsych (and JavaScript in general) are comparable to those taken in standard lab software like Psychophysics Toolbox and E-Prime. Response times measured in JavaScript tend to be a little bit longer (10-40ms), but have similar variance. See the following references for extensive work on this topic.
